# Workspace Switcher (`wss`)

A simple shell and Node.js utility for managing and navigating between VSCode `.code-workspace` folders from a central directory.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- üîç List all `.code-workspace` folders with indexed IDs
- üìÅ Easily `cd` into a workspace folder by ID
- üß† Works via a shell function to persist `cd` in your current shell
- üåç Supports a custom workspace folder location via `WORKSPACES_DIR` environment variable

---

## üì¶ Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wss.git ~/wss
````

### 2. Make sure Node.js is installed

```sh
node -v
# Should output v16 or higher
```

---

## üîß Set Your Workspaces Directory

This script looks for `.code-workspace` files in the directory set by the `WORKSPACES_DIR` environment variable.

### Example:

```sh
export WORKSPACES_DIR="$HOME/Workspaces"
```

Add this line to your shell config:

```sh
# ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
export WORKSPACES_DIR="$HOME/Workspaces"
```

Then reload:

```sh
source ~/.zshrc
# or
source ~/.bashrc
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

### From the command line:

#### List all workspace folders

```sh
~/wss/workspaces.sh ls
```

#### Change to a workspace folder by ID

```sh
source ~/wss/workspaces.sh cd <id>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **You must use `source`** so that the `cd` persists in your shell.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Shell Function

To simplify usage, add the following function to your shell config file (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):

```sh
workspace() {
  local script="$HOME/wss/workspaces.sh"

  case "$1" in
    ls)
      "$script" ls
      ;;
    cd)
      if [ -z "$2" ]; then
        echo "Usage: workspace cd <id>"
        return 1
      fi
      local dir
      dir="$(node "$(dirname "$script")/workspaces.js" cd "$2")"
      if [ -d "$dir" ]; then
        cd "$dir"
      else
        echo "‚ùå Directory does not exist: $dir"
        return 2
      fi
      ;;
    *)
      echo "Usage: workspace ls | cd <id>"
      return 1
      ;;
  esac
}
```

Reload your shell:

```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Example:

```sh
workspace ls       # View available workspaces
workspace cd 1     # Navigate to workspace folder with ID 1
```

---

## üóÉ How It Works

Each `.code-workspace` file should contain a structure like this:

```json
{
  "folders": [
    { "path": "project-a" },
    { "path": "../shared-libs" }
  ]
}
```

The script indexes all folders listed across all `.code-workspace` files in your `WORKSPACES_DIR`.

---

## üìÑ Scripts

### `workspaces.sh`

* Bash script for listing and switching workspace folders.
* Must be **sourced** when running `cd`.

### `workspaces.js`

* Node.js script that:

  * Lists workspace folders (`ls`)
  * Resolves full path by ID (`cd <id>`)
* Looks for workspace files in `$WORKSPACES_DIR` or current directory.

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

* **Nothing happens when I run `cd <id>`**
  Make sure you used `source ~/wss/workspaces.sh cd <id>` ‚Äî `cd` only works in the current shell.

* **‚ÄúNo workspace folders found.‚Äù**
  Check that `WORKSPACES_DIR` is set and contains `.code-workspace` files.
